# DPM-Project
Repository for ECSE 211: Design Principles and Methods.

The goal of the project is as follows:

Construct an autonomous robot to play a one-on-one game that is a cross between soccer
and basketball. The robot must be able to play either forward or defense and be capable
of navigating the field without hitting obstacles. Instructions are received via WiFi prior
to the game. 

The requirements of the project are subject to change at the professors' whim.

## Contributing
Make sure to follow these guidelines when collaborating:
* Don't create spuries releases. All releases must be approved by the whole team before being made.
* Try to keep each feature you develop on a different branch and merge into master with a pull request when you're done.
* Always branch off the latest release.
* Make sure the commit messages are concise and informative.
* Try to use bug IDs and commit IDs where you can to be more specific.
* If you have several spurious commits(ex: correcting spelling mistakes) then squash before you commit.

## Push Requests
When you begin to work on a feature, create a new branch for that feature. Once you're done working on it, issue a pull request
to merge with master. The pull request allows us to have a notification to test your module/feature.

Before any pull request can be approved it must be tested. This means that we have to prepare a test requiremesnt and outcome document.
The test requirements will be written by the programmer of that feature and will include
things like the expected operating input ranges and the expected outputs. A tester will then use this document to
test the feature/module. Only after the test outcome report has been published with an approval stamp, can the push request be approved.

## Feature and Module Development
A feature/module can be any component of code such as an interface, a function, a class or a modification to an algorithm. The requirements
are that the feature be self contained and easy to merge into the codebase.
