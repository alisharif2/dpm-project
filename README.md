## Contributing
Make sure to follow these guidelines when collaborating:
* Don't create spuries releases. All releases must be approved by the whole team before being made.
* Try to keep each feature you develop on a different branch and merge into master with a pull request when you're done.
* Always branch off the latest release.
* Make sure the commit messages are concise and informative.
* Try to use bug IDs and commit IDs where you can to be more specific.
* If you have several spurious commits(ex: correcting spelling mistakes) then squash before you commit.
